# Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 2025

## Introduction

NoUTM is a browser extension designed to remove tracking parameters from URLs. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe browsing experience.

## Data Collection

NoUTM does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension operates entirely locally on your browser:

- No user data is collected
- No browsing history is stored
- No analytics or tracking is implemented
- No data is sent to external servers

## How NoUTM Works

The extension simply removes tracking parameters from URLs as you browse. All processing happens locally in your browser:

- URL parameters are processed in real-time
- No data is stored between sessions
- No configuration is synced to external servers

## Third-Party Services

NoUTM does not integrate with any third-party services. The extension functions independently without any external dependencies.
